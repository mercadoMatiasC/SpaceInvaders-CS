# SpaceInvaders-CS
Space Invaders made in C# [I'm liking C# :)]

DON'T LET THE KING PINKU INVADE THE PLANET!

MOVE:  [A], [D] | SHOOT: [L]


// -- 3 LIVES -- //

For each missed shot or a shot into your own Cyan shields you will lose a life

// -- Enemies --//

If the King Pinku's troops are not eliminated in time before their field get to your shields, it's a GAME OVER. They'll make 5 vertical steps before so.

GOOD LUCK!
