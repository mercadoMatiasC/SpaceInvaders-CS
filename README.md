Space Invaders made in C#

// SPACE INVADERS IN C# --
// MADE BY MATIAS MERCADO (PINKU) 2019 - 2021
// I'm liking C# :)

//DON'T LET THE KING PINKU INVADE THE PLANET!

//MOVE:  [A][D]
//SHOOT: [L]

//-- 3 LIVES --
//For each missed shot you lose a life
//As well if you shoot your own Cyan shields.

//-- Enemies --
//If the King Pinku's troops are not eliminated
//in time before their field get to your shields
//it's a GAME OVER.
//They'll make 5 vertical steps before so.

//GOOD LUCK!
